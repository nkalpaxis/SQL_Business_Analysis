# SQL Business Analysis

In this project we're going to use SQL and the Chinook database to answer business questions. The Chinook database contains information about a fictional digital music shop. The tables within the database are as follows;

- employee
- customer
- invoice 
- invoice_line
- track
- playlist_track
- playlist
- media_type
- artist 
- album
- genre 

The SQL flavor that will be used throughout the project is SQLite. In order to run SQL queries in Jupyter we have to add %%sql on its own line before a query.
